# Brazil-UNFCCC-EconometricAnalysis

In this research, I will conduct a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between the cities of Brazil and the UNFCCC. 
I will focus on the key determinants of the cities: 1. Sign up to the UNFCCC, and 2. Undertake individual actions as part of 
the UNFCCC. Using both supervised and unsupervised techniques, I will assess the significance, magnitude and direction 
of linear and non-linear relationships between suitable predictor variables and all outcomes of interest.
